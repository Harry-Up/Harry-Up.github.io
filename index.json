However, similar changes have also been found in patients with major depressive disorder, prompting the question of specific triple network signatures for the two disorders. In this study, we proposed Supervised Convex Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SCNMF) to extract distributed multimodal brain patterns. These patterns distinguish schizophrenia and major depressive disorder in a latent lowdimensional space of the triple brain network. Specifically, 21 patients of schizophrenia and 25 patients of major depressive disorder were assessed by T1-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and resting-state functional MRIs. Individual structural and functional connectivity networks, based on pre-defined regions of the triple network were constructed, respectively. Afterwards, SCNMF was employed to extract the discriminative patterns. Experiments indicate that SCNMF allows extracting the low-rank discriminative patterns between the two disorders, achieving a classification accuracy of 82.6% based on the extracted functional and structural abnormalities with support vector machine. Experimental results show the specific brain patterns for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder that are multi-modal, complex, and distributed in the triple network. Parts of the prefrontal cortex including superior frontal gyri showed variation between patients with schizophrenia and major depression due to structural properties. In terms of functional properties, the middle cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and cingulate cortex were the most discriminative regions.","tags":["Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","Neuroimaging"],"title":"Low-rank Network Signatures in the Triple Network Separate Schizophrenia and Major Depressive Disorder","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544259600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561550268,"objectID":"701d4cb2566d268db35077778edb090a","permalink":"http://weihan95.com/talk/capsule-neural-network-and-discussion-on-synchronization-neural-network/","publishdate":"2018-12-08T20:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/capsule-neural-network-and-discussion-on-synchronization-neural-network/","section":"talk","summary":" ","tags":["Interpretable Machine Learning","Representation Learning","Deep Neural Network"],"title":"Capsule Neural Network and Discussion on Synchronization Neural Network","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533027600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561621736,"objectID":"7fee6c478189df822d1ef10f27838aeb","permalink":"http://weihan95.com/talk/tutorial-on-tensorflow-usage/","publishdate":"2018-07-31T20:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/tutorial-on-tensorflow-usage/","section":"talk","summary":" ","tags":["Python","Tensorflow","Deep Neural Network"],"title":"Tutorial on tensorflow usage","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Junming Shao","Zhongjing Yu","Peiyan Li","Wei Han","Christian Sorg","Qinli Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1502956704,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561550268,"objectID":"6847b4ab4f6a43abd0fbe6ff44f1b82b","permalink":"http://weihan95.com/publication/icdm2017/","publishdate":"2017-08-17T15:58:24+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/icdm2017/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we introduce a novel method to discover common and distinct structural connectivity patterns between SZP and MDD via a Cluster-Driven Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (called CD-NMF). Specifically, CD-NMF is applied to decompose the joint structural connectivity map into common and distinct parts, and each part is further factorized into two sub-matrices (i.e. common/distinct basis matrix and common/distinct encoding matrix) correspondingly. By imposing the clustering constraints on common and distinct encoding matrices, the discriminative patterns as well as the common patterns between the two disorders are extracted simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that CDNMF allows finding the common and distinct structural patterns effectively. More importantly, the derived distinct patterns, show powerful ability to discriminate the patients of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder.","tags":["Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","Neuroimaging"],"title":"Exploring Common and Distinct Structural Connectivity Patterns Between Schizophrenia and Major Depression via Cluster-Driven Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501059600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561550268,"objectID":"8967fe1479e86d9fdff65f5dc55ec22f","permalink":"http://weihan95.com/talk/representation-based-transfer-learning-and-some-advances/","publishdate":"2017-07-26T20:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/representation-based-transfer-learning-and-some-advances/","section":"talk","summary":" ","tags":["Transfer Learning","Adversarial Learning"],"title":"Representation-based Transfer Learning and Some Advances","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493802000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561550268,"objectID":"4516dde8eda16063ae686ad1f2a4d17e","permalink":"http://weihan95.com/talk/label-distribution-learning/","publishdate":"2017-05-03T20:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/label-distribution-learning/","section":"talk","summary":" ","tags":["Classification"],"title":"Label Distribution Learning","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1479286800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561550268,"objectID":"45dde897d2784ca4dabd93b75ca279cb","permalink":"http://weihan95.com/talk/preliminary-study-of-deep-learning/","publishdate":"2016-11-16T20:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/preliminary-study-of-deep-learning/","section":"talk","summary":" ","tags":["Deep Neural Network","Interpretable Machine Learning"],"title":"Preliminary Study of Deep Learning","type":"talk"}]
